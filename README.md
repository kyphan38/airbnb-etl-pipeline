# Introduction
Welcome to my project! Here, I have built an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline focused on automating the entire process of managing data for Airbnb listings in 38 cities across the US and Canada.

In this project, I utilize Docker for consistent container environments, Dagster for workflow orchestration, and Python and PySpark for data processing. The Medallion Architecture is employed for data organization. Together, these tools ensure a smooth process from extraction to loading. The cleaned and processed data is stored in PostgreSQL and MinIO, while BigQuery enables complex queries and Looker Studio facilitates map visualization.
